## For those concerned about using this
This program does not inject, modify or otherwise change "Black Desert Online" in any way. It simply is an external program that can be opened or closed at your leisure. The opacity of the bar allows the HP of a boss to be seen through the bar, allowing you to determine a more accurate percentage. It is similar, but not quite the same as an overlay from say Discord or Steam. As such, I am confident is saying that you will not get in trouble, suspended or banned by using it.

### Additional Info
- Currently only tested to work on 1440p displays, but I'm fairly confident it should work on 1080p and 4k displays.
- Only works when UI scale is set to 100.
